<i>[x2:]</i><br>
Me and you<br>
Yea, we gon' burn this city down<br>
And the only ones that'll make it out are<br>
Me and you<br>
Yea, it don't matter where we go<br>
We'll leave behind all that we know<br>
<br>
<i>[x2:]</i><br>
Just me and you (Just me and you)<br>
Just me and you (Just me and you)<br>
Just me and you<br>
Just doin' what we do now<br>
<br>
Listen up girl, I could be your getaway<br>
Loosen up girl, I can take your pain away<br>
So tonight baby we can throw the deuces up<br>
There's not much in this town for us anyway<br>
Let's shake this city like an earthquake<br>
I'll stand by you until my legs break<br>
Burn the city down, we can ride around top down<br>
Tell me how is that for a first date?<br>
<br>
'Cause I've been up for days<br>
Thinkin' bout escaping now<br>
We can have it made<br>
Fuck this place, we breaking out<br>
So peace out 'cause we gone<br>
Girl I know you nervous<br>
But we can take 'em on<br>
Us against them, the whole world versus...<br>
<br>
Me and you<br>
Yea, we're gon' burn this city down<br>
And the only ones that'll make it out are<br>
Me and you<br>
Yea, it don't matter where we go<br>
We'll leave behind all that we know<br>
<br>
<i>[x2:]</i><br>
Just me and you (Just me and you)<br>
Just me and you (Just me and you)<br>
Just me and you<br>
Just doin' what we do now<br>
<br>
Yea, you my partner in crime, like Bonnie &amp; Clyde<br>
Like Batman &amp; Robin, I'll catch you when you're fallin'<br>
Baby say the word, I'll come runnin' when you callin'<br>
I got your back like a saddle, if you sink baby I can be your paddle<br>
We like Harold &amp; Kumar<br>
One day I'm a make you a queen, put you in a White Castle<br>
<br>
Baby I've been up for days<br>
Thinkin' bout escaping now<br>
We can have it made<br>
Fuck this place, we breaking out<br>
So peace out 'cause we gone<br>
Girl I know you nervous<br>
But we can take em on<br>
Us against them, the whole world versus...<br>
<br>
Me and you<br>
Yea, we're gon' burn this city down<br>
And the only ones that'll make it out are<br>
Me and you<br>
Yea, it don't matter where we go<br>
We'll leave behind all that we know<br>

Us against them, the whole world versus...<br>
